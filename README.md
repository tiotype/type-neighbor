# Type Neighbor

Type Neighbor is a Gatsby 3 starter with a static type tester.

## Purpose

Type Neighbor is meant for type designers or foundries who use React or Gatsby for their specimen sites or portfolios. Its initial state is built with six fonts from the Google Fonts library as a means to demonstrate its functionality. You can easily add your own self-hosted web fonts, adjust the CSS, and customize the json data that is the basis for each individual type tester. It currently supports static font families or single fonts. Variable font tools and full glyph should be added in the future.

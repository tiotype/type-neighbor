## Type Neighbor

Type Neighbor is a Gatsby/React-based type tester boilerplate. It is meant for type designers or foundries who use React or Gatsby for their specimen sites or portfolios. The initial state of Type Neighbor is built with six fonts from the Google Fonts library as a means to demonstrate how it can work. It currently supports static font families or single fonts. Variable font tools and full glyph sets will be added in the future.
